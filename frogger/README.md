# 100 Days of Python Day 23 : 
### Turtle Crossing (aka Frogger)

Simulated the classic Frogger game using Python's turtle module

The player, car_manager, and scoreboard classes all inherit from turtle.

I later deviated from the original assignment by adding the ability for the
turtle to move backwards as well as detection for if the player goes off
screen by going backwards from the starting position.
