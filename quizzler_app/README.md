# Day 34 : Quiz App 

Utilizing the [the open trivia database](https://opentdb.com) API, the QuizBrain class fetches
10 random true/false questions. The user answers each question and is given response feedback by
the background color changing briefly to indicate a correct (green) or incorrect (red) response. 
The score is tracked in the upper right corner of the GUI. 

By modifying the parameters dictionary in the data.py file you can customize the question catagory.
See the API page linked above for catagory options and naming convention. 

Enjoy!
